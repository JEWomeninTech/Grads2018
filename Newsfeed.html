          <h2>Gitanjali Rao: Girl of 11 takes US young scientist prize</h2>
          <p>A schoolgirl aged 11 has been honoured as "America's top young scientist" for inventing a quick, low-cost test to detect lead-contaminated water.</P>
          <p>Gitanjali Rao was selected from 10 finalists who had spent three months collaborating with scientists to develop their ideas. Her device uses carbon nanotubes to detect the presence of lead.</p>
          <p>Gitanjali's invention was inspired by the scandal in Flint, Michigan, where officials are facing charges including manslaughter over water contamination in 2014-15. Until now, testing reliably for lead was expensive and meant sending away samples for analysis. But Gitanjali's portable invention - named Tethys, after the Greek goddess for fresh water - allows a sensor linked to a mobile app to give an accurate, almost immediate analysis via a mobile app.</p>

              <h2>Our 3 top tips to getting started in Tech</h2>
              <p>Technology is one of the fastest growing industries, desperate for bright and enthusiastic graduates. However, it’s not always the first choice career for female undergraduates. We’ve pulled together three top tips on breaking in to the sector and why it might just be the sector for you.</p>
              <p>1. Get to know the sector</p>
              <p>Technology is a broad sector with a plethora of different career paths. From coding and programming or technology advisory services through to systems infrastructure design - the career paths available to someone interested in technology are varied. It's worth researching what a career in technology will involve in order to understand the different options available to you.</p>
              <p>2. Be passionate and have confidence</p>
              <p>If you are thinking about following a career in Technology it is important to show you are passionate about the industry. This should come across in your communication (both written and verbal) at all times during an application process and particularly when going for an interview. Read up on recent industry trends and news stories and formulate a point of view on the implications and broader impact of the topics. If you're stuck for inspiration, ask yourself what risks and challenges exist within the industry. Be ready to talk confidently about what interests and excites you in the sector.</p>
              <p>3. Gain experience</p>
              <p>Work experience is a great way to show a potential employer that you are motivated and interested in the industry. First-hand experience is also a great way to get a unique insight into the type of work and role that you enjoy. It can be useful to draw upon examples from your work experience during interviews, so don't shy away from relevant experience, even if it's not directly related to what you think you want to do.</p>

                  <h2>The strange thing about Confidence</h2>
                  <p>Recently, I had the great pleasure to do a keynote speech about confidence for 50 inspiring young women in STEM aged between 14 and 22. I discussed what my main sources of confidence were, ranging from family and upbringing to past experiences and networks I built over time. </p>
                  <p>Yet weeks later I am left wondering, why do I still at times feel like the confidence meter is running low in professional settings? </p>
                  <p>There are several articles I have come across already discussing the notion of there being a ‘professional confidence’ and a ‘personal confidence’. While I never related with this concept previously, I now can see that most of my sources of confidence makeup my personal confidence, not my professional confidence.</p>
                  <p>As a recent grad, the amount of professional past experiences are very limited and the network while growing is also still quite small. </p>
                  <p>So how do we up our professional confidence meter?</p>
                  <p>There are several things that I have started doing which have already helped boost that my professional level of confidence:</p>
                  <p>1. Become a sponge!</p>
                  <p>The only way to gain experience is to throw yourself into things (especially if you never have done it before!) For me, I have been able to learn so much from my team and peers by getting stuck in and trying out new things. While you may not feel confident at first, by giving it a go you realise that it is not as hard as it seems! Before you know it, your professional confidence starts to grow.</p>
                  <p>2. Ask for help!</p>
                  <p>It is very easy to struggle in silence! (Trust me been there, done that, a lot!) By asking for help not only do we gain more insights, we also build our network as we open up and start to work with colleagues across the business with different specialism. </p>
                  <p>3. Keep on learning!</p>
                  <p>There are so many ways you can get your development game up! Start with the smaller steps like listening to a podcast or reading an article relevant to your role or field once a week. Equally, you can explore the bigger steps like taking on courses and workshops directly linked to your interest and passion. Once you are armed with knowledge and tools to help you prepare for those daunting scenarios, you will definitely find a boost in your confidence!</p>
                  <p>Tell us your thoughts!</p>
                  <p>While I keep on trying out new ways to boost that ‘professional confidence’ of mine it would be great to know, what do you think? Is there such a thing as a ‘personal’ and ‘professional’ confidence? Did you find your own ways to boost your confidence? Let us know, contact us and share your views!</p>
