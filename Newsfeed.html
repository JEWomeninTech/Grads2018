          <h2>Gitanjali Rao: Girl of 11 takes US young scientist prize</h2>
          <p>A schoolgirl aged 11 has been honoured as "America's top young scientist" for inventing a quick, low-cost test to detect lead-contaminated water.</P>
          <p>Gitanjali Rao was selected from 10 finalists who had spent three months collaborating with scientists to develop their ideas. Her device uses carbon nanotubes to detect the presence of lead.</p>
          <p>Gitanjali's invention was inspired by the scandal in Flint, Michigan, where officials are facing charges including manslaughter over water contamination in 2014-15. Until now, testing reliably for lead was expensive and meant sending away samples for analysis. But Gitanjali's portable invention - named Tethys, after the Greek goddess for fresh water - allows a sensor linked to a mobile app to give an accurate, almost immediate analysis via a mobile app.</p>

              <h2>Our 3 top tips to getting started in Tech</h2>
              <p>Technology is one of the fastest growing industries, desperate for bright and enthusiastic graduates. However, it’s not always the first choice career for female undergraduates. We’ve pulled together three top tips on breaking in to the sector and why it might just be the sector for you.</p>
              <p>1. Get to know the sector</p>
              <p>Technology is a broad sector with a plethora of different career paths. From coding and programming or technology advisory services through to systems infrastructure design - the career paths available to someone interested in technology are varied. It's worth researching what a career in technology will involve in order to understand the different options available to you.</p>
              <p>2. Be passionate and have confidence</p>
              <p>If you are thinking about following a career in Technology it is important to show you are passionate about the industry. This should come across in your communication (both written and verbal) at all times during an application process and particularly when going for an interview. Read up on recent industry trends and news stories and formulate a point of view on the implications and broader impact of the topics. If you're stuck for inspiration, ask yourself what risks and challenges exist within the industry. Be ready to talk confidently about what interests and excites you in the sector.</p>
              <p>3. Gain experience</p>
              <p>Work experience is a great way to show a potential employer that you are motivated and interested in the industry. First-hand experience is also a great way to get a unique insight into the type of work and role that you enjoy. It can be useful to draw upon examples from your work experience during interviews, so don't shy away from relevant experience, even if it's not directly related to what you think you want to do.</p>
